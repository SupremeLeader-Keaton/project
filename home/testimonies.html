I was very pleased with my experience at ProDoc+. I can be a hard critic of emergency care places and the people employed by them. Combine that attitude with an innate crankiness when I’m not feeling at all well and the result can be much less than pleasant. This time (My first time ProDoc+) was a world away from previous experiences elsewhere. It was good to be treated with professionalism and care. When I say the doctor and all the other employees of the ProDoc+ made me feel that I was in safe hands and even made me smile when I left, then you can believe they are the best. I am truly grateful and won’t get that awful feeling of dread the next time I get sick and am unable to see my own physician. I appreciated their follow-up and willingness to answer questions also. A big thank you to all of them.
